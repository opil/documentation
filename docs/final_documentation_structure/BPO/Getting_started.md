# Business Process Optimization
The OPIL BPO (Business Process Optimization) module determines an optimized solution to the optimized motion task sequencing problem. The major focus of BPO are actions that have to be executed by factory floor agents (humans and AGVs) to carry out logistics motion tasks. BPO takes as input a description of the capabilities of the environment, the agents, the cost of the agentsâ€™ actions and the expected system state as a task specification in a language specifically developed for this module.


## Getting Started
These instructions is about how to start the BPO docker container given a task specification using the HMI and SP OPIL modules. Agents could be robots, humans, items etc. BPO receives the setup of the environment, the enable transitions from one location to another, the initial state of the agents as the initial location of each agent and a task defined as objective. A task could be "Transport item C at location A". BPO receives these information in a language specifically developed for the needs of this module. Finally, BPO produce the sequence of actions as steps of a shortest path from the initial state of the agents to a target and the time needed.
