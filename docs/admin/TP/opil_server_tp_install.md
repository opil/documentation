# Introduction
 
Welcome to Module's Installation & Administration Guide! 

Any feedback on this document is highly welcome, including bug reports, typos or information you think should be included but is not. Please send the feedback through email to: module@l4ms.eu. Thank you in advance.

The "Software system" layer represents the highest level of OPIL where all the services that this platform provides to the end users are logically grouped by design. This level is made of three main modules. Task Planner is one of the three OPIL Components and Functional blocks which this 3rd Layer is made of. Regarding the OPIL architecture, this node consists of three different sub-modules. Firstly, the Task Supervisor monitors the execution of the task dispatched to the agents (Robots). Secondly, the Motion Task Planning plans the motion tasks for the robot agents. Lastly, the Business Process Optimization functional block decides and optimizes the tasks to be dispatched to the different agents (not included in v3.x of Opil). Task Planner makes it possible for the different components to communicate with each other and be composed into full-fledged logistic system in a manufacturing environment.

## MTP
The submodule Motion Task Planner (MTP) of the Task Planner (TP) is a software module as part of OPIL (Open Platform for Innovation in Logistics). The MTP modules creates/computes a motion task plan for the involved agents. This motion task provides a deadlock-free, optimal or near optimal path without loops and collision. Beyond this path computation the Motion Task Planning component handles the communication with the Agents. 
The MOD.SW.TP Motion Task Planning receives the start and end destinations of the appropriate Robot/ Human Agent Nodes. It computes the best, shortest and/or fastest path for the navigation and it handles the communication with the Robotic Agent Nodes (MOD.SW.RAN). Moreover, it is aware about the state, like current pose, current task, of the agents nodes.

## TS
The Task Supervisor (TS) module receives task specification from the HMI Module in an appropriate formal language and parameterized task specification. The TS process the received task information and assigns transport order to the available Robots. The Task Supervisor is also able to send the current state information to the HMI. Any changes inside the system will be handled through this sub-module.

# Installation

The module can be found in the following address:

https://docker.ramp.eu/?page=1#!taglist/opil/opil.sw.tp.ts

# How to start the TP docker container
This docker container starts the TP which receives the created graph of SP via orion.

To start a docker container prepare a docker-compose.yml following this example for the local machine:

```yml
services: 
  opil.mod.sw.tp.ts:
    image: "docker.ramp.eu/opil/opil.sw.tp.ts:latest"
    depends_on: 
      - opil.mod.sw.tp.mtp
    environment: 
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
      - "ROS_MASTER_URI=http://opil.mod.sw.tp.mtp:11311"
    volumes:
      - ./ts_fiware_config.ini:/catkin_ws/src/tasksupervisor/fiware_config.ini 
    ports: 
      - "2906:2906" 

  opil.mod.sw.tp.mtp: 
    image: "docker.ramp.eu/opil/opil.sw.tp.mtp:latest"
    environment: 
      - "ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311"
      - DISPLAY=$DISPLAY
    volumes:
      - /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw
      - ./mod_sw_tp.launch:/catkin_ws/src/mod_sw_tp/launch/mod_sw_tp.launch 
      - ./firos_robots.json:/catkin_ws/src/firos/config/robots.json
      - ./firos_whitelist.json:/catkin_ws/src/firos/config/whitelist.json
      - ./firos_config.json:/catkin_ws/src/firos/config/config.json
    ports: 
      - "11311:11311"
      - "39001:39001"
            
version: "3.5"
```
Before you can start the docker container, some configuration files must be created. Create this files beside your **docker-compose.yml**
```
- firos_config.json
- firos_robots.json
- firos_whitelist.json
- mod_sw_tp.launch
- ts_fiware_config.ini
```
```
touch firos_config.json firos_robots.json firos_whitelist.json mod_sw_tp.launch ts_fiware_config.ini
```
A detailed description of this files is given in the subsequent sections.

To start the container from the folder where you put your docker-compose.yml file execute the following commands:

```
xhost local:root
docker-compose up
```

After you started it a window opens where you can see the graph. It takes some time until the whole graph is ready. If no edges or vertices are longer added to the graph TP is ready to use.

In windows OS you need to open command prompt and type docker-compose up from the folder where you saved docker-compose.yml. The display in windows OS does not work, so you will not be able to see visualizations of topic exchange in rviz, but you can see subscriptions and entities in a web browser.

## Configuration of Firos

The communication with RAN and SP through orion is realized via firos. For subscribing to the right topics on ROS site and subscribing to the right entities on orion site, firos needs to be configured. Therefore three different configurations are needed. Create the following empty files beside the above created ***docker-compose.yml***.

```
- firos_config.json
- firos_robots.json
- firos_whitelist.json
```

A detailed description of firos is given here: https://firos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

### firos_config.json

The ***config.json*** describes the local and remote connection to the orion context broker. For a detailed description follow these instructions: https://firos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/configuration-files.html

Copy this content to ***firos_config.json*** (preconfigured for RAN and TP v3.X and above):
```json
{
  "environment": "docker",

  "docker": {
    "server": {
        "port"      : 10102
    },
    "contextbroker": {
        "address"   : "<orion address>",
        "port"      : 1026,
        "subscription": {
          "throttling": 0,
          "subscription_length": 300,
          "subscription_refresh_delay": 0.5
        }
    },
    "endpoint": {
      "address": "<local network address>",
      "port": 39001
    },
    "log_level": "INFO"
  }
}
```

### firos_robots.json

The ***robots.json*** subscribe to the topic of /map/graph which is provided by SP to generate the graph for the routing. In version 3.X and above only one robot is preconfigured. The data for the robot is published to following topics:

```
- /robot_opil_v2/motion_assignment
- /robot_opil_v2/action_assignment
- /robot_opil_v2/cancel_order
```

The following topics are subscribed from RAN:

```
- /robot_opil_v2/current_motion
- /robot_opil_v2/robot_description
```

If you add more robots to the system you have to add the topics with the namespace here. The namespace is given by the RAN and has to be used. For a detailed description of how to setup the robots.json follow this instructions: https://firos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/configuration-files.html#robotsjson

The following naming convention should be used:
```
/opil/iot/ran_<uuid>
E.g.: /opil/iot/ran_fb3d75a1a82550ffb3e6e4b2bcae482e (uuid v5 for "robot_0")
```

Copy this content to ***firos_robots.json*** (preconfigured for RAN and TP v3.X and above):
```json
{
    "map": {
        "topics": {
            "graph": {
                "msg": "maptogridmap.msg.Graph",
                "type": "publisher"
            }
        }
    },
    "robot_opil_v2": {
        "topics": {
            "current_motion": {
                "msg": "mars_agent_physical_robot_msgs.msg.Motion",
                "type": "publisher"
            },
            "robot_description": {
                "msg": "mars_agent_physical_robot_msgs.msg.RobotAgentProperties",
                "type": "publisher"
            },
            "cancel_order": {
                "msg": "mars_agent_physical_robot_msgs.msg.CancelTask",
                "type": "subscriber"
            },
            "motion_assignment": {
                "msg": "mars_agent_physical_robot_msgs.msg.MotionAssignment",
                "type": "subscriber"
            },
            "action_assignment": {
                "msg": "mars_agent_physical_robot_msgs.msg.ActionAssignment",
                "type": "subscriber"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### firos_whitelist.json

The ***whitelist.json*** is needed by firos to subscribe to the topics described in the robots.json. All topics from the robots.json must be listed here. For a more detailed description follow this instructions: https://firos.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/configuration-files.html#whitelistjson

Copy this content to ***firos_whitelist.json*** (preconfigured for RAN and TP v3.X and above):
```json
{
    "map": {
        "publisher": [
            "graph"
        ],
        "subscriber": []
    },
    "robot_opil_v2": {
        "publisher": [
            "current_motion",
            "robot_description"
        ],
        "subscriber": [
            "cancel_order",
            "motion_assignment",
            "action_assignment"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Configuration of MTP

The MTP consist of three different modules: Topology, Router and Logical Agents. The topology is started by a module called *mars_topology_launcher* which listens to the topic /map/graph which is provided by SP. After a map is received, the topology is started automatically by the module. Subsequently the TP is ready to use.

The whole configuration file is listed below (mod_sw_tp.launch, preconfigured for RAN and TP v3.X and above):

```xml
<launch>

  <node pkg="tf2_ros" type="static_transform_publisher" name="link1_broadcaster" args="0 0 0 0 0 0 1 world map" />

  <!-- ****** Yellow Pages ***** -->
  <include file="$(find mars_yellow_pages)/launch/mars_yellow_pages.launch" />

  <!--  ****** Topology *****  -->
  <include file="$(find mars_topology_launcher)/launch/mars_topology_launcher_generic.launch">
    <arg name="log_level" value="info" />
    <arg name="topo_file_type" value="opil_sp" />
    <arg name="mars_vertex_footprint_radius" value="0.95" />
    <arg name="topology_launch_mode" default="container"/>
  </include>

  <!-- ****** Router ***** -->
  <include file="$(find mars_routing_base)/launch/mars_routing_base.launch" />

  <!-- ****** Logical Agent (robot_0) ***** -->
  <include file="$(find mars_agent_logical_agv)/launch/mars_agent_logical_agv.launch">
    <arg name="physical_robot_namespace" value=""/>
    <arg name="robot_name" value="robot_opil_v2" />
    <arg name="physical_agent_id" value="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" />
    <arg name="physical_agent_description" value="robot_0" />
    <arg name="current_topology_entity_id" value="e53201ce-c3e3-53ed-b3df-daf27fcbb8e9" />
    <!-- Parking spot: P0 -->
    <arg name="parking_spot_entity_id" default="e53201ce-c3e3-53ed-b3df-daf27fcbb8e9" />
    <arg name="parking_spot_entity_type" default="10" />
    <arg name="parking_allowed" default="true" />

    <!-- ZFT hall rb1 setup -->
    <arg name="node_name" value="ran_00000000000000000000000000000001" />
  </include>

  <!-- ****** Firos ***** -->
  <node name="firos" pkg="firos" type="core.py"/>

  <node type="rviz" name="rviz" pkg="rviz" args="-d $(find mod_sw_tp)/rviz/config.rviz" />

</launch>
```

Following you find a more detailed description of the launch file and the parameter.

### Topology

Following you can see the configuration for the topology launcher module:

```xml
  <!-- ****** Yellow Pages ***** -->
  <include file="$(find mars_yellow_pages)/launch/mars_yellow_pages.launch" />
  
  <!--  ****** Topology *****  -->
  <include file="$(find mars_topology_launcher)/launch/mars_topology_launcher_generic.launch">
    <arg name="log_level" value="info" /> <!--log levels: debug, info, warn, error -->
    <arg name="topo_file_type" value="opil_sp" /> <!-- don't change this line -->
    <arg name="mars_vertex_footprint_radius" value="0.95" /> <!-- IMPORTANT: This value must be smaller (mars_vertex_footprint_radius < (cell_size / 2)) then the cell_size of SP!-->
    <arg name="topology_launch_mode" default="container"/>
  </include>
```

The log level for starting the topology can be set with the following command. Possible values are: **debug**, **info**, **warn**, **error**
```xml
<arg name="log_level" value="info" />
``` 

The **topo_file_type** parameter tells the program which kind of topology is expected. DON'T CHANGE THIS LINE!
```xml
<arg name="topo_file_type" value="opil_sp" /> 
```
The **mars_vertex_footprint_radius** describes the size of the bounding box which is created by the topology launcher around each vertex. Important: This value must be smaller (**mars_vertex_footprint_radius** < **(cell_size / 2)**) then the half of the **cell_size** of SP! Value is in meter. The next assumption is that the **mars_vertex_footprint_radius** is greater than the AGV turning radius defined in RANs robot description with the parameter **footprint_x** and **footprint_y**. It follows: **"AGV turning radius" < mars_vertex_footprint_radius < (cell_size / 2)**
```xml
<arg name="mars_vertex_footprint_radius" value="0.95" />
```
The **topology_launch_mode** sets the launch mode to **container**. This means that the topology is launched inside one container instead of individual agents. DON'T CHANGE THIS LINE!
```xml
<arg name="topology_launch_mode" default="container"/>
```

### Router
The Routing module which calculates the path for each robot can be started without any additional configuration. 
```xml
  <!-- ****** Router ***** -->
  <include file="$(find mars_routing_base)/launch/mars_routing_base.launch" />
```

### Logical Agent(s)
Each RAN of the system is represented by a logical agent. The logical agents manages the high level tasks, like receiving and managing transport orders from the TS. For version 3.X, one AGV is preconfigured. 

```xml
  <!-- ****** Logical Agent (robot_0) ***** -->
  <include file="$(find mars_agent_logical_agv)/launch/mars_agent_logical_agv.launch">
    <arg name="robot_name" value="robot_opil_v2" />
    <arg name="physical_agent_id" value="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" />
    <arg name="physical_agent_description" value="robot_0" />
    <arg name="current_topology_entity_id" value="e53201ce-c3e3-53ed-b3df-daf27fcbb8e9" />
    <!-- Parking spot: P0 -->
    <arg name="parking_spot_entity_id" default="e53201ce-c3e3-53ed-b3df-daf27fcbb8e9" />
    <arg name="parking_spot_entity_type" default="10" />
    <arg name="parking_allowed" default="true" />

    <!-- ZFT hall rb1 setup -->
    <arg name="node_name" value="ran_00000000000000000000000000000001" />
    <arg name="physical_robot_namespace" value=""/>
  </include>
```

The parameter **physical_robot_namespace** configures the namespace used by the ran. For e.g.: /opil/iot/ (In v3.X and above no namespace is configured)
```xml
<arg name="physical_robot_namespace" value=""/>
```

Name of the robot. Used to subscribe to the right robot topics. Layout of the topic structure: /physical_robot_namespace/robot_name/topics
```xml
<arg name="robot_name" value="robot_opil_v2" />
```

UUID of the physical agent. Id can be created randomly (UUID v4) or from a name (UUID v5). Important: The ID must be unique! For more information about UUID visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier
```xml
<arg name="physical_agent_id" value="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001" />
```

Human readable name of the robot.
```xml
<arg name="physical_agent_description" value="robot_0" />
```

ID of the current node or edge on which the robot is located. Node end edge names are generated by SP. To translate a node oder edge name into a uuid, use UUID v5.
```xml
<arg name="current_topology_entity_id" value="0a8b9081-d84c-5660-909c-134d55bf4966" />
```

Name of the node. Topics and service are published as followed: /namespace/node_name/topic|service
```xml
<arg name="node_name" value="ran_00000000000000000000000000000001" />
```

ID of the node where the robot goes parking. A robot drives to this location if it doesn't receive a new order.
```xml
<arg name="parking_spot_entity_id" default="e53201ce-c3e3-53ed-b3df-daf27fcbb8e9" />
```

Type of the parking node. Currently not used.
```xml
<arg name="parking_spot_entity_type" default="10" />
```

Allows the AGV to go parking if it's idle.
```xml
    <arg name="parking_allowed" default="true" />
```

## Configuration of TS
Following the configuration of the TS (ts_fiware_config.ini):

```ini
[flask]
host = 0.0.0.0

[taskplanner] 
host = 10.64.6.176 
PORT = 2906 

[contextbroker]
host= 192.168.100.76 
port=1026

[robots]
# These ids needs to be comma seperated, currently only robot 1 is used: ran_00000000000000000000000000000001 with 'Misc' capabilities and name 'MSM_Sim'
# AGV 92990e07d46e5c62a00e6976071a358d and 67a4f54b8ed959e295a4f8da11045dca are only examples
ids = ran_00000000000000000000000000000001, 92990e07d46e5c62a00e6976071a358d, 67a4f54b8ed959e295a4f8da11045dca
# Capabilities can be self defined in TL under Location -> Type
# E.g.: 
# Location dropoffItem
#     name = "ws1_dropoff"
#     type = "SmallLoadCarrier"
# end
types = SmallLoadCarrier, Misc, OtherCapability
# Names of the robots
names = MSM_Sim, emili, robotinik
```

Example task for the ran docker simulation:
```ini
Location pickupItem
    name = "pickup"
    type = "SmallLoadCarrier"
end

Location dropoffItem
    name = "dropoff"
    type = "SmallLoadCarrier"
end

    name = "virtualSensorCallAgv"
    type = "Boolean"
end

Event s1Loaded
    name = "virtualSensorAgvS1Loaded1"
    type = "Boolean"
end

Event s2Unloaded
    name = "virtualSensorAgvS2Unloaded"
    type = "Boolean"
end


TransportOrderStep s1
    Location pickupItem  # Only one Location can be defined!
    FinishedBy s1Loaded == True 
end

TransportOrderStep s2
    Location dropoffItem
    FinishedBy s2Unloaded == True
end

task SupplyTaskFromS1ToS2
    # Transport Order now needs TransportOrderSteps instead of regular instances
    TriggeredBy callAgv == True
    Transport
    from s1
    to s2
end
```
